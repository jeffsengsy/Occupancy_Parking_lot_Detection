# Occupancy_Parking_lot_Detection
# :oncoming_automobile:
This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect the occupancy status of parking spaces in a parking lot. It is designed to help improve the management of parking spaces by providing real-time data on whether a space is occupied or available. This system can be integrated into smart cities or used for parking lot management solutions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Detects whether parking spots are occupied or available using live video feed.
- **Multiple Parking Lot Support:** Capable of handling multiple parking lots in a single system.
- **Scalable:** The solution is flexible enough to work with a wide range of camera setups and can scale for large parking facilities.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses pre-trained models or custom-trained deep learning models for image recognition.
